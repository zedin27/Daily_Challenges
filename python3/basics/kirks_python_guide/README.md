# The-Basics-of-Python
This is a small interactive Python file which should be edited via IDLE, it will hopefully help you better understand the basis on which Python operates.

My goal is that by the end of this short exercise, you will be able to understand the foundations of Python. I hope everyone can benefit from this, and I put a lot of time and effort into this, despite how short it seems. I would love feedback!

Please feel free to email me at kworley@csumb.edu if there is anything you would like to see added, feel I missed, or just general feedback.

Thanks!
